# Goodgame gangster earning money bot
Program lets you earn money by creating new accounts and transfering their money to your main account (by 1v1 duels).


## FAQ

#### - How much can i earn?

Program lets you earn 10 000$ per 2 minutes (one iteration), which is 300 000$ per hour.
Basically you have to use it on fresh account, because the money transfer will be highest (1 lvl duel with another 1 lvl).
So grind first level and once you're happy with the results you can proceed further (I recommend staying on 1 lvl).

#### - How to use?

- Download python project/.exe file from Releases tab
- Run application (GUI.exe - if you downloaded from Releases or GUI.py if you downloaded whole project)
- Once you open it for the first time - go through the configuration steps, which are shown underneath on the video
- Enter boosted account's username
- Enter iteration type (finite/infinite)
- (optional) Enter number of iterations
- Press start
- (optional) If you entered wrong image during configuration - go to "Settings" and "Clear" button.

Currently works on World 1 server. So if you want to use it - create new account on world 1.
